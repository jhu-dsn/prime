Upon receiving PO-Request(i, j, content):

     a. If I don't yet have a PO-Request for (i, j), store it and mark
     	that I should ack it.

     b. If I did have one for (i, j), then if it matches, don't store
     	it but mark that I should ack it again.  If it doesn't match,
     	then construct a blacklist message and broadcast it to
     	everyone because it represents proof that server i is
     	compromised.
