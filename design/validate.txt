1. Role of the Validate_Message() function

   a. Basic length checking

      (1) Packet must contain enough bytes for a header: signature,
      	  machine_id, data length, packet type.

      (2) Make sure the length field is not too big.  It must be
      	  smaller than MAX_PACKET_SIZE - header_size.

      (3) Number of bytes received must equal the header size plus the
      	  data length field.

   b. Message type

      (1) Make sure the message type is one of the valid types.

   c. ID range

      (1) Make sure the machine_id is within the range, which is from
      	  one to the number of principles.

      (2) Classify the ID as either a server or a client.

   d. Message type and sender type matching

      (1) Classify the message type as having either a server source
       	  or a client source.

      (2) If the machine_id is a server, make sure the message type
      	  source is server.  Same for if the machine_id is a client.

   e. Verify the packet's signature.

2. Validate_Update()

   a. Make sure the data length field is at least the size of the
      update_message.  This allows for the possibility of an update
      having 0 bytes.  To enforce updates that are at least one byte,
      make sure data length is at least sizeof(update_message) + 1.

3. Validate_PO_Request()
