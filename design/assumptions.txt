1. Update Message

   a. The configuration file will allow a server to map from client_id
      to an <IP, Port> pair.  

   b. Servers know the public key of the client and can verify
      signatures contained in update messages.

   c. If a client wants to ensure that a request is executed, it needs
      to wait for a reply before sending the next request.  If it does
      not wait, it is possible there can be gaps.

   d. Servers store a copy of the latest reply sent to each client.
      If an update with an older timestamp is received, it can safely
      be discarded because the client must have already obtained a
      response.  If an update with the current timestamp is received,
      the server sends the stored copy of the latest reply.  If an
      update with a newer timestamp is received, the server processes
      it.

   e. Servers store, for each client, the timestamp of the latest
      update executed for that client.  Initialized to zero.
