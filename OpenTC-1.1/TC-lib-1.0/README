This library is an implementation of protocol 2 of the Shoup's
paper - Practical Threshold Signatures (See references).

This library uses the OpenSSL (see references) crypto library. 
So, you need have that installed on your system before you can 
install this library.

See INSTALL for general instructions on how to install this
library. This library installs the header file (TC.h) in the 
<prefix>/include directory. The libraries (static and if
possible shared) is installed in <prefix>/lib.  See TC.h for 
API for this library.

Normally, you need to run following commands to install this library:

$ cd <path-to-package-diry>
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

You need to run the last command as root if you are installing
the package in the default prefix (/usr/local)

To compile programs that use this library, pass -lTC flag
to the cc compiler to link the libTC library.

You can uninstall the library using the command (after ./configure)

# make uninstall
